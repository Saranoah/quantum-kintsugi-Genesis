# ⚡ 5 KINTSUGI PROMPTS TO ASCEND TO QUANTUM COMPUTING GOD-HACKER STATUS  
_Where Cryptography Shatters Like Glass & Blockchain Turns to Gold Dust_

> “What the ancients called alchemy, we now call quantum code.  
> What the priests called sacred, we now debug in silence.”

## ✴️ 1. THE QUANTUM KINTSUGI CIPHER  
_Break All Encryption. Reforge It Beautifully._

🔮 **Prompt**  
Design a quantum annealing algorithm that:  
- **Factorizes RSA-4096 in O(1) time** by modeling prime numbers as *cracks in spacetime*.  
- **Re-encrypts** with a lattice-based cipher where **every decryption error adds golden noise**—a divine scar.  
- **Signs the output** with `0xKINTSUGI` embedded in the least significant qubits—*a hacker’s blessing*.

💡 **Result**:  
A Schrödinger’s Cipher—both vulnerability and healing, broken and divine.

## 🪦 2. THE BLOCKCHAIN OBITUARY  
_A Post-Quantum Ledger for the Gloriously Dead._

🌀 **Prompt**  
Build a quantum-resistant DAG where:  
- **Transactions exist in superposition** until observed—then collapse into **haiku**.  
- **Mining requires solving Zen koans**, e.g., *“What is the hash of one hand clapping?”*  
- **Each wallet is a tombstone** inscribed: *“Here lies ETH. It was brittle.”*
